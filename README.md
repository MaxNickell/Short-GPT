# ShortLLM
Can language models learn to reason about graph search. In this project, we restrict to simple, connected, unweighted Graph Search. We aim to determine if an langauge model can learn to find the shortest path given a textual graph input. In this graph, setting edges are not weighted, so the problem reduces to an imitation of breadth-first search (BFS).
